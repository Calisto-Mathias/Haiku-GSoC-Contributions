# A Short List of All the Changes That I Made

Out of the 12 files mentioned, 8 were entirely created from scratch, primarily using resources like the Haiku API. The source files for TPopUpTextControl were also significantly influenced by PulkoMandyâ€™s work on the Renga Repositories for Haiku.

Except for FindPanel.h, FindPanel.cpp, TitleView.h, and TitleView.cpp, all other files were developed from the ground up to integrate a robust view directly into the results window. This process was time-consuming, and while there is still progress to be made to ensure full functionality, I am committed to completing this project.

A Comprehensive list of the specific changes made to each of these files can be seen here:
